## Architecture Analysis

### Working Message Flow
```
1. Session Creation ‚Üí NATS KV Store ‚úÖ
2. Document Upload ‚Üí documents.download topic ‚úÖ  
3. Worker Processing ‚Üí Document chunking & embeddings ‚úÖ
4. Question Submission ‚Üí chat.questions topic ‚úÖ
5. Answer Processing ‚Üí Generated with sources ‚úÖ
6. Answer Delivery ‚Üí chat.answers.{session_id} ‚úÖ (via NATS)
7. Answer Delivery ‚Üí WebSocket ‚ö†Ô∏è (routing incomplete)
```

### Infrastructure Status
- **NATS JetStream Topics:** All properly configured
- **Milvus Collections:** medical_documents (768-dim vectors, 33 docs)
- **Worker Services:** Processing documents and questions
- **API Services:** All endpoints responding

## Issues & Recommendations

### üü° Issue 1: WebSocket Answer Routing
**Problem:** WebSocket clients connect successfully but don't receive answers from the NATS message system.

**Root Cause:** The WebSocket manager likely needs integration work to bridge NATS `chat.answers.{session_id}` messages to connected WebSocket clients.

**Recommendation:**
```python
# WebSocket manager should subscribe to NATS topics and forward to clients
async def route_nats_to_websocket():
    for session_id, websocket in active_connections:
        await js.subscribe(f"chat.answers.{session_id}", 
                          cb=lambda msg: websocket.send_json(msg.data))
```

**Priority:** Medium (UI can work with polling, but WebSocket preferred for UX)

### üü¢ Issue 2: System Performance
**Status:** Excellent performance observed
- Question processing: ~3 seconds end-to-end
- Vector search: Sub-second response times  
- Session operations: <100ms

### üü¢ Issue 3: Answer Quality
**Status:** High quality answers confirmed
- Proper Portuguese responses
- Relevant source attribution
- Good context understanding
- Appropriate medical domain knowledge
